| August 31   |   12:30-1:00pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I attempted to whiteboard my solution. |
| August 31   |   1:00-1:30 pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                   I figured out whether snakes mattered or not, because they could help lead to a ladder on a previous square. |
| August 31   | 1:30 pm - 2:00 pm |                                                                                                                                 The size of the ladders for an initial square doesn't matter because a smaller ladder leading to a square near a larger ladder could be better than a bigger ladder initially. |
| August 31   |  2:00 - 2:30 pm   |                                                             I decided to end up using a brute force tactic which utilized all the paths and breaked after only the first one made it to the final square, as this would be the fastest path with the lowest number of rolls, the only thing that is important. |
| August 31   |  2:30 - 3:00 pm   | I coded the initial classes of Moksha Square and Moksha Path. Moksha square is the intiial square on the moksha patam board. The moksha path is the array list of integers that represent the square values that lead to finish. The shortest possible Moksha path has the least number of squares/dice rolls. |
| August 31   | 3:00 pm - 3:30 pm |                                                                                                                                                 I debated whether to code the dice roll function that collects different paths as a recursive function. I found it harder and decided to stick with for loops. |
| August 31   |   3:30 - 4:00pm   |                                                                                                                                               I continued to code dice rolls giving all permutation/combination for all possible dice rolls and incrementing new paths and generalizing for all possibilities. |
| August 31   |  4:00 - 4:30 pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                      I coded traverse to next square that is incrementing the square after a jump or a bite based on information on the board. |
| August 31   |  4:30 - 5:00 pm   |                                                                                                                                                I coded print statements to see if board intiializating was working fine. I realized I had to increase the size of the board from position 0 to n, including n. |
| August 31   |  5:00 - 5:30 pm   |                                                                                                                                                                        I had to put a break because the code seemed to be loopig in the creating new paths and seemed to be duplicating in creating new paths. |
| August 31   |   5:30 - 6:00pm   |                                                                                                                                                                         Adding new squares in the path was showing empty arraylist. This was because the board was not initializing properly and erasing to 0. |
| August 31   | 10:00pm - 10:30pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I put in more print statements to check whether adding paths was working properly. |
| August 31   | 10:30 - 11:00 pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                 I was checking whether a path is done or not to continue, but continuing with path calculation even when some paths were done. |
| August 31   | 11:00 - 11:30 pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I tested the code and even the basic test was failing. |
| August 31   | 11:30pm - 12:00am |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I continued testing and debugging the code. |
| September 1 |  10:00 - 10:30am  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I decided to use break and not continue path calculation once a path was done. |
| September 1 |  10:30 - 11:00am  |                                                                                                                                                                                It was giving an initial 2 squares error and so I inverted onstead of going from dice 1-6, I inverted the for loop from 6 to 1. |
| September 1 | 11:00 - 11:30 am  |                                                                                                                                                                                          I moved the check of where the paths are done at the end of the for loop instead of at the beginning of the for loop. |
| September 1 | 11:30am - 12:00pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The basic tests started passing. |
